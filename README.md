# Demo Showcase - Chat Interface

A showcase project demonstrating my skills in integrating modern web technologies to build a responsive chat interface with emotion detection.

## Project Description

- Real-time chat interface with user/AI messages
- Emotion detection with color-coded progress bars
- Full markdown support including code blocks
- Mobile-responsive design
- Custom avatar system with SVG graphics
- Modular component structure with TypeScript interfaces

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (latest version with App Router)
- **PromptKit Library** for chat input components
- **shadcn/ui** component library integration
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design
- **Custom component architecture** with proper TypeScript types

## How to Clone and Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed on your machine

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NightFury-9b71/coding-partner.git
cd coding-partner
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Open in browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

That's it! The chat interface should be running locally.

## What You'll See

- A clean chat interface with sample conversation
- Emotion tags below each message with progress bars
- Responsive design that adapts to mobile screens
- Markdown rendering for code examples
- Custom avatars for user and AI messages

### TypeScript Structure
Organized with proper interfaces and modular architecture:
- `src/types/chat.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/components/EmotionTags.tsx` - Custom components
- `src/data/chat-messages.ts` - Sample data
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

This project demonstrates practical integration skills with modern React ecosystem tools while maintaining clean, maintainable code structure.
